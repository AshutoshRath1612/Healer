            <p class="leading-relaxed">Although experts are still learning a lot about the COVID-19 vaccines, there are
              some clear benefits to getting vaccinated.<br></p>


            <b>A COVID-19 vaccine might:</b><br>
            <ul>
              <li>•Protect you from getting COVID-19</li>
              <li>•Prevent you from becoming seriously ill, becoming hospitalized or dying due to COVID-19</li>
              <li>•Limiting the spread of COVID-19</li>
            </ul>
            <p><br>
              <b><i>The vaccine reduces your risk of infection.</i></b><br>

              Once you receive your first shot, your body begins producing antibodies to the coronavirus. These
              antibodies help your immune system fight the virus if you happen to be exposed, so it reduces your chance
              of getting the disease. There are three vaccines available for use in the United States, and they are all
              effective in preventing infection.<br>

              It’s true that you can still become infected after being vaccinated, but once more of the population is
              vaccinated, those chances are further reduced thanks to something called herd immunity. So getting
              vaccinated not only reduces your chance of being infected, it also contributes to community protection,
              reducing the likelihood of virus transmission.<br>
              <br>
              <b><i>The vaccine can help your unborn baby or newborn.</i></b><br>
              Studies have found that expectant mothers who receive the COVID-19 vaccine create antibodies to the virus
              and pass those to their unborn baby through the placenta. Mothers were also shown to pass antibodies to
              their newborns through breast milk. This suggests those newborns have some immunity to the virus, which is
              especially important as young children cannot get the vaccine.<br>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-medium text-gray-900 title-font mb-2"> Precaution or Advisory Guidlines </h2>
            <p class="leading-relaxed">What you need to know before, during and after receiving a COVID-19 vaccine<br>
              <b>Before you go:</b><br>
              Do your research. There’s a lot of misinformation about vaccines online, so it’s important to always get
              your information from trustworthy sources like UNICEF and WHO. If you have any questions about whether you
              should receive a COVID-19 vaccine, speak to your doctor.<br>
              At present, people with the following health conditions should not receive a COVID-19 vaccine to avoid any
              possible adverse effects:<br>
              If you have a history of severe allergic reactions to any ingredients of a COVID-19 vaccine.<br>

              If you are currently sick or experiencing symptoms of COVID-19 (although you can get vaccinated once you
              have recovered and your doctor has approved).<br>


              Talk to your doctor. If you’ve ever experienced a severe allergic reaction from any vaccine or you have
              any questions about the medications you are currently taking, talk to your health care provider before
              your appointment.<br>

              Take care of yourself. Get a good night’s rest and hydrate well before your vaccination so you can feel
              your best on the day.<br>

              <br>
              <b> During the appointment</b><br>

              Stay safe. Make sure to follow safety precautions at the vaccination facility such as physical distancing
              while waiting and wearing a mask.<br>

              Communicate. Let the health care professional know if you have any medical conditions that could be
              considered precautions, such as pregnancy or a compromised immune system.<br>

              Keep your records. You should receive a vaccination card that tells you which COVID-19 vaccine you
              received, when you received it and where you received it. Make sure to hold on to this card in the event
              that you need it in the future.<br>
              <br>
              <b>After you’ve been vaccinated</b><br>

              Stay for monitoring. The health care provider should observe you for about 15 minutes after the vaccine is
              administered to make sure you don’t have any immediate reactions. However, it is extremely rare for severe
              health reactions.<br>

              Be prepared for some side effects. Vaccines are designed to give you immunity without the dangers of
              getting the disease. While it’s normal to build immunity without side effects, it’s also common to
              experience some mild-to-moderate side effects that go away within a few days on their own.<br>

              Some of the mild-to-moderate side effects you may experience after vaccination include:<br>

              Arm soreness at the injection site<br>
            <ul>
              <li>Mild fever</li>
              <li>Fatigue</li>
              <li>Headaches</li>
              <li>Muscle or joint aches </li>
              <li>Chills</li>
              <li>Diarrhoea</li>
            </ul>
            If any symptoms continue for more than a few days or if you experience a more severe reaction, then contact
            your health care provider immediately.<br>

            <b>Be patient.</b> Building immunity takes time. <br></p>
